The Lord: \u201cThey may be-lieve that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of George Jackson, the God of Marcus Garvey, and the God of Nat Turner has appeared to you.\u201d Then Bim said to the Lord, \u201cO my Lord I\u2019m not a eloquent speaker, neither before or since you have spoken to your servant.\u201d So the Lord said to him, \u201cWho has made man\u2019s mouth?

Downs said, \u201cWho is the lord, that I should obey his voice to let Vaughn17 go? I do not know the lord nor will I let Vaughn17 go!\u201d As a result D.A.G.

Stars glancing through an open window, reflected light scaling the walls, the floor. Moonlight across the crusted steel barrel of an old hunting rifle. Everywhere the same sound \u2013 the steady breath of the ocean, waves pushing in and out, in and out, inescapable, hope and oblivion.\n\nWednesday morning.\n\nHer eyes shot open. She cast the linen bedsheet off her body \u2013 it was late. Gentle, mid-morning light wafted through the window, leaping from the ocean and welcoming the bedroom into the day with an even glow. She looked next to her, the bed was empty. He was already awake, she could smell the coffee and slightly burnt toast downstairs. \n\nIt was their fourth morning in these unfamiliar surroundings; the beach house of a friend of theirs, away visiting in-laws in Chile. This vacation, disguised as housesitting, was their first in years \u2013 \u201cmaybe ever?\u201d he had teased her. This morning was the latest in a long string of awakenings, dating back so long she couldn't remember, of eyes opening to a deadness, a shame, a fidgeting that had to be satiated, that she knew how to fix \u2013 but couldn\u2019t. \n\nShe looked around the room. To the left, a huge window looking out at the gruff, long grass that gave way to sand, then the ocean. A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf covered the wall opposite the bed, the books organized by color, from brilliant red in the top-left corner, winding through purples, blues, greens and ending at white. The titles were familiar, many of them the same ones they had at their own apartment back in the city: old issues of New Left Review, the Little Red Book, Prisoners of the American Dream. \n\nShe looked to her right, past the clock on the woodgrain nightstand, the time displayed in bright red, towards the corner, where a ribbed ceramic vase hoisted a dead bunch of peonies. The flowers seemed to slump in real time. She got up, threw on a pair of shorts, and walked downstairs. \n\nWednesday morning, later.\n\nHe was bustling around the kitchen, sliding PB&Js into a ragged backpack, filling water bottles, checking how much time was left on the coffee, his face brimming with excitement for their hike \u2013 along the ocean, then up on the dunes, ending at what the visitor center\u2019s map called \u201cthe end of the world.\u201d He was talking to her, but she wasn\u2019t listening. On her phone, she saw flashes of familiar scenes \u2013 dread inducing, miles away \u2013 different worlds, yet within reach. Or maybe she was remembering \u2014 or maybe she was imagining \u2014 \n\nThe police rushed the line without warning, riot shields and batons splotchy and stained, picket signs torn from broken fingers, heads inadequately covered as they hit the pavement \u2013 \n\nAnother pipeline burst \u2013 a gorgeous, murky plume, oily smoke and brilliant orange flame overexposed against the atonal white of the northern tundra, the tacky wiring of the homemade explosive littering the snow, the camouflaged men in binoculars looking on \u2013 \n\nGloved hands switch the body cameras off as the SWAT team rounds the corner, emerging from the crowded forest to the grove where forest defenders lie in their hammocks \u2013 one looks up, the red dot instantly part of their visage, the gunshot muffled by the silencer \u2013 \n\nHe tapped her shoulder, holding out a Nalgene filled with homemade red Gatorade. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d \n\nWednesday afternoon.\n\nAs they trudged along the sandy path, the glistening sea opening wide besides them, she remembered the first time she saw him. His eyes, she told him many times after, had been on fire. \n\nAt the time they had lived so close to the chest, so viscerally. She could still see those memories \u2013 but as they were now, blips in time, a montage. She could see him, dizzy with intensity, in the popcorn-ceilinged basement of the faculty building where they met with other union reps from City University, dining workers, janitors, grad students, writing what would be their power map \u2013 \u201cour manifesto,\u201d he insisted \u2013 of industrial trade unionism at the university. They were townies, staff, not professors \u2013 but it was euphoric. She would meet him in the Ethiopian cafe across from campus, they were reading things like State and Revolution and Industrial Unionism, devising formulas to put the books into practice. The things she\u2019d dreamed, that now seemed impossible. \n\nShe remembered biking along the river, weaving between the dotted lines on the path, him laughing while he pedaled to keep up with her. \n\nShe remembered him leading her to his backyard, staying up for hours making picket signs by moonlight. \n\nShe remembered his hand on her arm, still, gentle, anticipatory, as they peered around the corner of the brick building where the police were staging. She remembered sneaking past the chatting officers, gutting the back tires of the SUVs.  \n\nShe saw the gorgeous arc of his arm, that summer night, the humidity suffocating beneath her mask, the sweat sparkling beneath his electric green eyes as he lobbed a brick into the glass window of the DHS.  \n\nShe remembered kneeling next to him, digging out carrots in their block\u2019s community garden.  She remembered eating prosciutto and drinking negronis out of a mason jar on the roof of the science library, when they finally found a key to the door.  \n\nShe remembered lying next to him in the park, the sun burning her cheeks, his head on her shoulder, the drummers by the fountain beating out a syncopated rhythm. \n\nShe remembered him clutching her while they huddled behind a torched Prius, the sound of marching footsteps growing louder, kissing the gash on her head, whispering \u201cit won\u2019t be long. It won\u2019t be long.\u201d \n\nShe looked at him now, his silhouette stepping in and out of focus along the beach \u2014 the curls in his hair, his head cocked, darting back and forth as he smiled towards the ocean \u2014 and she started to cry.   \n\nWednesday evening.\n\nHe sat at the edge of the dock, breathing in the ocean air \u2013 breathing slowly, slower than he ever could in the city, deeper too. He looked down at his feet, tickling the surface of the lapping water. He had left her staring at the shed, her hands clutching at each other, no longer crying, her eyes empty.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to let us be here, she had said. I didn\u2019t want to let us be comfortable. \n\nThey had fought when they got back to the house, quietly, then furiously, then quietly, then silently, and finally with a rage that was still trembling in his chest, trailing each other around the bedroom, the kitchen, out onto the porch. Was he shaken by what she had said? By what she now thought of him, what she had maybe thought of him for weeks, months, but that he was now just seeing? By the person she now considered him to be: leisurely, passive, definitive, unrevolutionary, comfortable? Was he shaken because she was right \u2013 and he hadn\u2019t noticed? \n\nWe said we would fight with anyone who was fighting, and now all you care about is your fucking research, she had sobbed. What is that going to do??\n\nHe knew the fire in her chest. He knew the shame she felt; he saw it when she thought he wasn\u2019t looking, when she stared into the nothingness at the center of the dinner table, when she bit her lip watching footage of the dockworkers\u2019 strike or reading the coded report-backs from the pipeline hunters in Canada. He sighed, flicking his feet into the water, flecks of saltwater foam clinging to his legs. Maybe she was right. He had fallen in love with her and the revolution, and then he had fallen in love with their life \u2013 maybe together, those three things took up too much room. Maybe.\n\nI can\u2019t do this, she said, \u2013 I can\u2019t sit around, thinking, meeting \u2026 writing. I mean, can you? \n\nHe suddenly felt clammy, short of breath. He turned around and looked back towards the house. What were they if not two revolutionaries \u2013 comrades in love? \n\nWednesday night.\n\nHe opened the sliding door and stepped from the porch into the living room. He looked in the kitchen, then hurried up the stairs \u2013 her bag was gone, the bed hastily made, the books she had borrowed from the shelf stacked on the night stand. There was a Bola\xf1o novella on his pillow, an envelope sticking out at the top. He opened the book, looked at the envelope \u2013 but it was empty; only a makeshift bookmark. \n\nHe looked out the window. Somewhere out there was the ocean, but in the dark, with the bedroom light on, he could only see his blurred, faceless silhouette. \n\nWednesday night.\n\nShe wiped away the sweat or tears or both clinging to her cheek and pushed open the creaky door of the shed, stepping over spiky marram grass. Streaks of shimmering moonlight glimmered faintly on the crusted barrel of the old hunting rifle, the stars glanced through the window. She reached out and felt the old, steady grip of the rifle, which likely didn\u2019t hold any bullets but held the possibility of an act, blood on the street, her blood maybe, someone\u2019s, spilt for a world to win. She laughed to herself, snot bubbling from her nose. She didn\u2019t even know if this thing worked. \n\nOutside she heard the steady breath of the ocean waves pushing in and out, in and out, in and out, whispering ancient hope, inescapable oblivion. \n\nEND \n\nwww.stopcopcitysolidarity.org/",images:[{url:"lezp.png",alt:"On the Beach",size:"small"},{url:"lezp2.png",alt:"On the Beach",size:"small"}],footnote:""},{id:7,title:"Greens Are Good",author:"K.T.

The basic facts of the Tok are as follows. First, we see a jaguar attack a capybara. Next, we observe as a crocodile attacks the presumed same jaguar (\u201caggressor\u201d). Finally, we see two separate clips of the initial capybara (thankfully living) riding on the back of the crocodile that appeared in the second clip. Mental state and intent should never be presumed, but it should be obvious that the crocodile and capybara are seeking revenge and looking for the aggressor. \n\nBased on the perceived climate as well as the biological data our team has collected on capybara and jaguar residences and mating habitats, we can assume the incident in the video occurred in South America. Likely Brazil. However, I am not an expert in Brazilian tort law (yet) and we therefore will adapt our analysis to an American jurisprudential lens. As a certified American torts law expert (see e.g. academic transcript indicating completion of required 1L course) this is a clear case of assault and battery. \n\nAssault is generally defined as an intentional act that puts another person (or jungle creature) in reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. No physical injury is required, but the actor must have intended to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the victim, and the victim must have thereby been put in immediate apprehension of such a contact. Cornell website that contains all laws. \n\nBattery is an intentional tort. When a person (or jungle creature) intentionally causes harmful or offensive contact with another person, the act is battery. However, if the plaintiff expressly consented to such an act or gave implied consent by participating in a particular event or situation (e.g., consensual, sensual misdeeds with defendant), they are not liable. Id. \n\nWe can clearly establish that the capybara did not consent to any contact from the jaguar. While the torts are obvious in the video (at least to an expert), this Tok represents a much more detailed and purposefully curated philosophical legal engagement applicable to the American criminal legal system. Dating back to Hammurabi\u2019s Code and the theory of \u2018lex talionis\u2019, the law has focused on retaliatory justice. See Also the Bible (Exodus) and the Talmud (Moses\u2019s Divine Law) and The Qur\u2019an (Sura 5:45) (illustrating the similar principle of retaliation and the adage that an eye for an eye does not in fact make the whole world blind, but instead makes us all feel better). *We note that Biblical scholars may rebut the reference to Exodus as indicative of the Bible with a reference to Leviticus 19:18 \u2013 \u201cDo not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord.\u201d However, Leviticus 10:6 also says God is going to get angry if you rip your clothes or leave your hair unkempt. Not to mention the hate speech that has emerged from Leviticus 18:22. Point being, this journal disrespectfully does not recognize the book of Leviticus as any sort of legal or moral authority.* \n\nThe western world has adopted this philosophy. Today instead of taking an eye for an eye, the American legal system has shifted to taking \u2018the ability to move freely throughout the world for an eye\u2019 or \u2018vast money and sanctions for an eye.\u2019 The crocodile is representative of the criminal justice system, bent on retribution. The crocodile knows there are alternatives to dealing with this situation and making the capybara \u201cwhole\u201d again, but instead of shifting the jungle ecosystem to a more rehabilitative model of crime and punishment, the crocodile is firmly entrenched in traditionalist criminal legal practice (represented by its status as one of the oldest creatures with many scales). The punitive order decreed by the crocodile works to punish the jaguar in a way that will remove it from society and prevent further harm to the capybara. Capybaras throughout the jungle will pick up the newspaper in the morning, read the verdict that another jaguar has been dealt with appropriately, nod in approval, and then reference the incident to their capybara grandchildren during capybara thanksgiving and say something like \u201cif jaguars don\u2019t want to be punished then they should stop biting.\u201d \n\nHowever, what the crocodile and capybaras fail to see (represented by the poor eyesight of said animals) is the long-term effects of this approach. That jaguar has a family that will now be without its primary source of income. 87% of fatherless jaguars resort to a life of crime, primarily in the form of eating capybaras, as a means of providing for their families. So, an action with the intention of protecting capybaras is creating more harm. The additional reality is crocodiles hold prejudice against jaguars and continue to hide their bigotry behind a thin veil of legal justifications. \n\nFor the harmed capybara, crime remains a high salience, low comprehension issue. The capybara is happy to ride the legal system down river without realizing the true impact of their decisions to pursue damages as a victim of this crime. Maybe the solution is to put more capybaras in prison. Make criminal justice a personal issue so capybaras stop casting judgment from behind their disconnected veils of perception. If capybaras had opposable thumbs, I\u2019d say they should stop throwing stones from glass houses. If the system functions in a way where capybaras are punished for crimes and that punishment is designed to ruin their lives, the lives of their families, create unrest in their communities, perpetuate generational wealth inequality, and turn them into the kind of animals who do the sorts of things that the animal kingdom defines as criminal,  then maybe the crocodiles (we all know crocodiles are controlled by capybaras) will be forced to reconsider their approach to criminal justice instead of continuing to attack brown and black peo\u2026.shit\u2026jaguars. \n\nJaguar populations are dwindling in the wild. There has been a 20% decline in the population in the past 14 years and their conservation status is currently listed as \u201cnear threatened.\u201d Instead of allowing crocodiles to needlessly exact retribution, there need to be alternative means to justice. Put the jaguar and capybara in a room. A controlled environment where a mediator (maybe a buffalo, idk) can allow both parties to express their grievances and apologize. The power of personal connection, eye contact, and allowing aggrieved parties to be heard is unrivaled. This approach has proven successful in South Africa. Failing this reconciliation approach, there needs to be a greater effort to understand why the jaguar decided to do what it did. Maybe the jaguar is houseless, jobless, or suffering from a debilitating mental condition. In all of these situations there are solutions that do not include removing the jaguar from society. The demilitarization of schools, revitalization of education at all levels and for all animals, a health system that provides free physical and mental health care to all, decriminalization of drugs, and a justice system based on reparation and reconciliation rather than retribution and vengeance. \n\nWhat is rooted is easy to nourish.

She wore almost exclusively cheetah print and drank primarily energy drink powders that she used her long plastic fingernails to tap into a clear blue Aquafina water bottle with a green cap. The shade of lipstick she wore every day was called \u2018Meow Meow Magenta\u2019 and the shade of nail polish she wore every day was called \u2018Fuck me Fireman Red.\u2019 Her voice was nasally, especially when she stood at the front of the classroom and said \u201clisten up, class.\u201d She had a long-term boyfriend named Joseph Bangbottom, and her nickname for him was Mr. Bang. He drove a white car and had one gold tooth and three rings on each of his hands. On special occasions, he would add a fourth. If the occasion was celebratory, he would add it to his right hand, and if it was conciliatory, his left. \n\nAfter class got out, Mr. Bang would pick Bianca up in the front of school and they would go to the drive-thru. She liked Carl\u2019s Jr. but he liked Jack in the Box, so they switched off depending on what they\u2019d had most recently and also any unresolved conflicts or arguments in their relationship. Then they would go back to her place and watch a movie and probably have sex. Mr. Bang lived with his mom, and ate dinner with her every night, so between the hours of seven p.m. and midnight, Bianca Delathorpe usually found herself alone. She made herself a microwave meal and poured herself a glass of wine and watched Netflix or cable until she passed out on the couch. She would stir around two a.m.\u2014she was a light sleeper\u2014and drag herself to bed, set an alarm for 5 a.m. the next morning, wake up, shower, and get ready to go back to school again. She had been dating Mr. Bang for seven years. Their relationship worked because they were both the kind of people who liked to talk about getting married but didn\u2019t actually want to get married, and also the sex was good. \n\nBianca Delathorpe didn\u2019t know it but once for a school report, a student in an alien kindergarten had to sort the population of earth numerically by happiness. The assignment was about efficient data presentation of ten-figure quantities, which was fairly typical of the curriculum for an Uuoontsan kindergarten on B9-Exalta. The student, Xancquathocar, accurately placed Delathorpe at 2,789,653, putting her in the top 0.09 percentile of happiest people living on the planet Earth at the time of the last Anti-Federalist intergalactic census. Number one was Brian Waites, who suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was seven years old and spent the next sixty-seven years of his life in a neurological trauma-induced bliss. Number 7,837,491,265 was too horrible to describe. Number 7,837,491,264 was Robert Blanc-West, a senior partner and top litigator at corporate defense firm Stines, Gates, Ill & Cobb, who was tying a noose made of the neckties his ex-wife had given him for the seven birthdays they spent together to the ceiling fan of his office at the point in time the census data was psychically collected. \n\nWhen Xancquathocar (whose lontsa \u2013 Uuoontsan for \u2018long-term monogamous sex partner\u2019 affectionately called him \u2018Mr. Car\u2019) was tasked with coming up with a definition of happiness to use for his assignment, he decided on the seventh universal metric used by intergalactic Anti-Federalist economists, which was: the relative differential between one\u2019s current state of being and one\u2019s knowledge of one\u2019s highest possible state of being. In equational terms, this looked like. C.S. (current self) - (K.O. x H.S. (knowledge of higher self\u2019s potential multiplied by higher self\u2019s actual potential) = H (happiness). \nBianca Delathorpe\u2019s equation looked like this. \n\n69.7 - (0.28 x 100) = 69.420\n\nBrian Waites\u2019 equation looked like this. \n\n100 \u2013 (0 x 100) = 100.000\n\nAnd, if you\u2019re still curious, Robert Blanc-West\u2019s equation looked like this. \n\n23 \u2013 (96.7 x 100) = -73.700\n\nMr. Car got a B-plus on his report and went on to work for a psycho-pharmaceutical company on Quant-609.\n",images:[],footnote:""},{id:17,title:"",author:"",columnCount:"1",text:"",images:[{url:"img_9.png",alt:"Conflicts Checked",size:"small"}],footnote:""},{id:18,title:"",author:"",columnCount:"1",text:"",images:[{url:"img_10.png",alt:"Conflicts Checked",size:"small"}],footnote:""},{id:19,title:"Front Line",author:"Nikila Smith",columnCount:"2",text:"Who\u2019s on the front lines risking their lives?
